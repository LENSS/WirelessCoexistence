Here are the code for the Markov Chain model for unsaturated coexistence.
autotest.m is the entry point.
coexist_channel*.m are the model (with channel model) for the TWC paper.
delay*.m files are for the delay computation and the tuning part.
qos*.m files are for the qos computation and the tuning part.
