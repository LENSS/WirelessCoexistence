This time the model is verified by a ns3 based simulator. We use a  simple 802.11 modual written by a third party instead of the original one in ns3 because it is too complicated.
To verify the accuracy of the ns3 simulator, we compare the results from our Monte Carlo simulator for saturation against the ones generated by the ns3 one. 
Monte Carlo is for the code/logs of the Monte Carlo based simulator for saturated coexistence.
