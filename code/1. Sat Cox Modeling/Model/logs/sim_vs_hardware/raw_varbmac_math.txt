fsolve completed because the vector of function values is near zero
as measured by the default value of the function tolerance, and
the problem appears regular as measured by the gradient.

Equation solved, fsolve stalled.

fsolve stopped because the relative size of the current step is less than the
default value of the step size tolerance and the vector of function values
is near zero as measured by the default value of the function tolerance.
