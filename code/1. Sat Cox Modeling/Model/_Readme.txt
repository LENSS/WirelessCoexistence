Here are the code for the Markov Chain model for saturated coexistence.
autotest.m is the entry point for MASS13 paper.
with_timing*m are the code for the model for the MASS13 paper.
coexist_simplest*.m are the model for the INFOCOM13 paper.
coexist_channel*.m are the model (with channel model) for the TWC paper.
