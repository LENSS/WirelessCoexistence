Here are the code for the Markov Chain model of PSM.
autotest.m is the entry point.
solver4d_unsat*m are the code for the 4-D Markov Chain model of PSM.
solver4d_unsat_tm*m are the code for the 4-D Markov Chain model of PSM, but using transition matrix to solve the Markov Chain (hoping it would be faster but failed eventaully because the 4-D Markov Chain has too many states).
Other .m files are for internal usage.
